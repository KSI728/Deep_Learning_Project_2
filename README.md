# Deep_Learning_Project_2
This project focuses on natural language processing, specifically generating poems that begin with a given word. 
I have uploaded two versions: one using an LSTM model and the other using the KOGPT2 model.
The make_poetry file contains the LSTM model. (I have also included the code for web crawling.)
